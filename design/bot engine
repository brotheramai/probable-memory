I wonder if I can use inkle?
yup, I totally can
in fact there's even a js port of it!
https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs

so the only thing I have to worry about is saving / loading data into ink
maybe.
I can also probably also extend ink by just checking anything it returns for my own special markup/merge fields.
Better yet, ink supports 'tagging' which does nothing in the engine, but you can get the tags out of the engine.

So perhaps a grammar like
value_producing_command(param)? resulting_action_that_takes_said_value target
so for example
# capture set priority
means present a text box and save the result into the 'priority' variable
# list(priorities) set priority
means present a set of choices based on the 'priorities' list (kept outside of ink) and then save the results into the 'priority' variable in ink
# capture append priorities
means present a textbox and add the result to the priorities list
# list(priorities) remove priorities
means present the list of priorities as options and remove whichever is selected from the priorities list
# create(list) set priorities
means create variable called 'priorities' with value []
# lval set priority
means set 'priority' to a blank list
# val(a) append priorities
means provide the value 'a' then append it to the priorities list
# val create whatever
means create a variable called whatever and do not set a value

Another thing to consider is if I want to just use inkjs for the whole thing or if I want to use it for each conversation and build the non-conversation parts in js directly?
Considering how much custom stuff I'm building already I don't know if it'd be worth it.

DEPRECATED (because cordova makes it way easier to load JSON than javascript, plus that's way safer anyway)
# run(function)
means run a js function named function
