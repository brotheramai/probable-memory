so, it looks like inkjs doesn't handle tags? like, it doesn't return them from the story object.

also, ink itself has no way to recieve input from the player.
I could take the text on the app side, set and ink variable and then the story would be able to continue using the value that I set.

there is similarly no way I know of to have ink return a different number of options.
like there are threads, which maybe could be combined with conditionals to keep accruing more options, but that's like not super helpful if the options themselves need to be varied.
like, the options could take values from variables, but again, not great really. You'd have to have a variable defined ahead of time.

so I could have priority_1 through priority_10 defined, then check if they're empty and have them show or hide as appropriate, and if I combined this with storing responses in a global variable I could maybe get inkle to handle variable numbers of user-supplied text. But like, it feels like I'd be doing a lot to make that happen and really it isn't worthwhile since I need to store user-supplied information externally anyway so that it persists between sessions.

So if I figure out how to get ink to return markup to me then I can catch it and know to either fetch custom user data and store it, or to render a specific list of options and store the selection.

man, if only ink lists were dynamic, then I could just use those.

all of this makes me think that maybe ink isn't worth it. In the end I really should get this onto phones so I can do notifications. Like browsers have those, but I can't imagine anyone uses them. Besides, we're always carrying phones in our hands, not laptops.
nevermind, I can use cordova/electron to get this app wherever I need it without issue (and while using html, css, and javascript, and therefore inkjs is still on the table as an option.)

also, I bet cordova has a built in webserver so I can undo my www-data changes
